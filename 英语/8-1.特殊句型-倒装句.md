### 倒装句

**前置知识**

1. 独立谓语
   eg: I finish my homework.(只有一个谓语动词，独立谓语)

2. 复合谓语

eg: He can marry a pretty wife.(can marry 两个谓语，称作**复合谓语**)

**识别倒装的结构**

1. 谓语放主语前
   - 谓语放主语前：全倒装
   - 助动词，情态动词放在主语前：半倒装

```js
/*
eg: The bus comes here。
// 转换
Here comes the bus. (全倒装)

eg: I did know little about it.
// 转换
Little did I know about it. (半倒装，助动词did在主语I之前)
*/
```

2. 倒装句的变形方法？
   1. 找出原句的谓语动词
   2. 复合谓语：把情态动词/助动词提到主语前即可实现半倒装
   3. 独立谓语：需要借助动词(只能 do，does，did)，把借的助动词放在主语前，并把原句的动词单三或过去式变成原形。

```js
/*
eg: I have a book。
// 转换
Do I have a book.

eg: She had a book.
// 转换
Did she had a book.

eg: She had finished her work before last week.
// 转换
had She finished her work before last week.
*/
```

**半倒装的具体使用情况**

1. 否定词放于句首，后用半倒装
   - never/seldom/few/little/not/nowhere/rarely(很少)/barely(几乎不)
   - by no means/in no case/in no way/under no circumsatnce/at no time/on no account(绝不)
2. only(只有) + 状语，放于句首后用半倒装
   - by + doing 方式
   - when/after/before... 时间
   - in/at/on.. 地点
   - if 条件
3. so/such 放于句首，后用半倒装
   - So + 形/副 + that 从句
   - Such + 名 + 半倒 + that 从句
4. 反复倒装
   - 题目构成：句 1 + 句 2
   - 解题方法：1. 句 1 是肯定句 <=> So + 助/情态 v + 主语 表"也是"的意思。 2.句 1 是否定句：Neither/Nor + 助/情态 v + 主语"也不是"

5. 四大加分句型
   1. "一...就..."句型
      - **Hardly/Scarcely + had + 主语 + done + when + 从句**
      - **No sooner + had + 主语 + done + than + 从句**
      - 例句： eg: Hardly had I got the bus stop when the bus started.
   2. Not only ... but also ... 句型 表“不但...而且...”
      - **Not only 半倒装，but also 不用半倒装**
      - eg：Not only can Tom sing so well, but also all his fmaily members are good singers.
   3. Not until... 表"直到...才..."
      - **前不倒后倒**
      - eg: Not until next week will the sports metting be held.
