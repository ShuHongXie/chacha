### 名词性从句

学习策略：准确掌握名词性从句引导词的用法
含义：在主从复合句中，充当主语，宾语，表语，同位语的从句

### 主语从句

含义：从句作为主语

1. 常在句首，主句谓语动词之前

```js
/*
eg: What he does every day is boring. 主句(What he does every day)
eg: That i love you is true. 主句(That i love you)
*/
```

2. it 作形式主语，真正的主语是 that 从句

```js
/*
eg: It is necessary that we finish our task early. 主句(that we finish our task early)
*/
```

### 宾语从句

1. 常位于动词，介词之后

```js
/*
eg: I believe that you will pass the exam.  宾语(you will pass the exam.)
eg: I think about what I should do.  宾语(what I should do.)
*/
```

2. it 作形式宾语，真正的宾语是 that 从句

```js
/*
eg: I think it important that I will never give up. 宾语(that I will never give up)
*/
```

### 表语从句

1. 常跟在系动词(be 动词，感官系动词)后

```js
/*
eg: Our plan is that we will get married next year。 表语(that we will get married next year)
eg: It seems that it is going to snow. 表语(that it is going to snow)
*/
```

### 同位语从句

1. 常放在抽象名词后，对其进行解释说明，通常由 that 引导

常见抽象名词：fact，news(新闻)，idea(想法)，doubt(疑问)，conclusion(结论)，evidence

```js
/*
eg: That is the fact that he passed the CET-6.
*/
```

**注意区别定语从句和同位语从句**

- 同位语从句：抽象名词 + 从句，解释说明作用; that 做引导词，不充当句子成分。
- 定语从句：先行词 + 从句，修饰限定作用。that 作关系代词，替代先行词在从句充当基本成分。

比如下面的：

```js
/*
下面的fact是个抽象的事物
eg: That is the fact that he passed the CET-6. (同位语从句)

下面的book是个具体的事物
eg: That is the book that he bought last week. (定语从句)
*/
```
