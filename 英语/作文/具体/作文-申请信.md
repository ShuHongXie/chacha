Dear Sir,
  I am Lihua and I heard the running club will be recruiting some members last week. I am interested in running too, and I want to join running club, so I am writing this letter for you to let you know my strength int the running.

  First of all, I have done a running at least 5km everyday since I graduated from my high school. What's more, when I was a child, my father had taught many running skills for me that made me had a lot of experiences in running, not only from my father, but also from my practice. In addition, I won a school running prize in my school sport competition, because I had a lot of advanced running equipment. At last, I am ready to join the University sports competition and if I win some prize in a competition, it is helping the club to get the reputation and recruit more members for this year.

  I sincerely hope you can let me to join to the club and I promise that I will be trying my best for the club. Wish you will have a nice day!

Best regards,
      Li hua
