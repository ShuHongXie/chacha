 Dear Customer Service,

  I am Li Ming, a customer of your travel agency. I had a bad journey in your travel agency recently that made me unhappy. So I am writing this complaint letter to you to tell you why I am so unhappy.

  First of all, the food is so bad. Not only just have a bread in the journey, but also the bread is smelly and the price of drinking water is so expensive. What's more, the hotel is so loud, even I heard the music from the hotel and I saw the crowd dancing in the outside playground. In addition, the chairs of our travel bus are uncomfortable, even I saw this chair had broken out and I saw some windows had many dusts. At last, our travel agency should prepare some brochures to introduce the information of mountains and temples, that we can undetstand the history of the temples and the basic information of mountains.

  It is important for travel agency to make some changes. I hope you can understand my complaint. Wish the next's customer will have a better expreience.

  Best regards,
      Li Ming

 假设你在某个商店买到了不好的东西，现在你需要写信给老板跟老板说一下问题

 Dear Sir,

  I am Li Ming, a customer of your shop. I had a bad experience in your shop recently that made me unhappy. So I am writing this complaint letter to tell you why I am so unhappy and give you some advices.

  First of all, there are many dusts in your shop. Not only in the goods cabinets, but also in the cashier desk. What's more, the cashier is so crude that made me feel as if I am a prisoner and he have a bad motion when I given him money. In addition, there are many expired goods in your shop, which will hurt a customer's health. At last, some goods on the shelves are so high that I can't touch it. So I hope you can clear your expired goods and format the situation of your goods.

  It is important for you to absorb my suggestion. If you solve the problems, your shop will more popular. Wish the next customer will have a good experience.

  Best regards,
      Li Ming
