 Dear Customer Service,

  I am Li Ming, a customer of your travel agency. I had a bad journey in your travel agency recently that made me unhappy. So I am writing this complaint letter to you to tell you why I am so unhappy.

  First of all, the food is so bad. Not only just have a bread in the journey, but also the bread is smelly and the price of drinking water is so expensive. What's more, the hotel is so loud, even I heard the music from the hotel and I saw the crowd dancing in the outside playground. In addition, the chairs of our travel bus are uncomfortable, even I saw this chair had broken out and I saw some windows had many dusts. At last, our travel agency should prepare some brochures to introduce the information of mountains and temples, that we can undetstand the history of the temples and the basic information of mountains.

  It is important for travel agency to make some changes. I hope you can understand my complaint. Wish the next's customer will have a better expreience.

  Best Regard,
      Li Ming
