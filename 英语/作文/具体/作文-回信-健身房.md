Dear Tom,
  How is everything going? I am Li Hua. I am so happy when I received your mail in which you mentioned that you want to know some information about our school gym. So I am writing this email to you to give you some information about our school gym.

  First of all, there are many programs in our school gym, including running, swimming and so on. What's more, our school gym is near our school playground and you can go to the school gym at 12:00 to 22:00 every day, remembering to take your student card so that you don't spend money. In addition, the school gym has three coaches who can teach you how to swim in the swimming pool or do other excises. At last, you should clean the gym equipments that you use before you leave school gym and close the school gym door carefully.

  Wish you will be happy in the school gym. If you have any trouble in school gym, you can call for me.

Best regards,
      Li Hua
