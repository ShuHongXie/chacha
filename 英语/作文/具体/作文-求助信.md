Dear Brown,

  First of all, I know you had worked in art at least 10 years. If you can help us to design a poster about about the information about our English club, our recruitment task will more successful. What's more, I know you also helped the other clubs to design their poster, so that you must be having a lot of inspirations in poster design. It is good for you to get more experiences about poster design.

  We sincerely hope you can help us and we are waiting for your reply.
