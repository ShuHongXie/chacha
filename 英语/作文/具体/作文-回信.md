你叫张新，与李明是好朋友，在不同大学读书。你得知他沉迷于(indulge in)玩网络游戏(online game-playing)，影响了学习,期末考试有几门课程不及格。请给他写封信，说明沉迷网游的危害，劝他珍惜大学时光，学好专业知识。温提示:不可将上述内容直接翻译成英语;信中不能出现考生的真实姓名与学校名。

Dear Li Ming,
  How is everything going? I am Zhang Xin, I felt so bad when I heard that you had a fail test in the end of the semester because you had indulged in online game-playing. So I am writing this letter for you to give you some suggestion.

  Playing computer game not only let you indulge in it, but also decline your study enthusiasm and hurt you interpersonal. As a college student, it is important for you to get a good degree, which can make you have a good performance when you start an interview or your future. Your technique is a key to earn money and your score is your application. I sincerely hope you can stop playing computer game.

  In all, if you have any trouble, call for me immediately and I will try my best to help you. Remember, we are friends forever.

                                                                        Best regards,
                                                                           Zhang xin
