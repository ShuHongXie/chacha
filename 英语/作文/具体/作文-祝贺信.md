Dear Zhang Qiang,
  How is everything going? I am Li Ming and I am delighted for you when I heard you will join the university that you like after a year's study hard. So I am writing this letter to you to give you some advices in the university and wish you can live better.

  When I recalled our school life in high school. I can't forget those things that we did, including studying overnight, going out school to eat some delicious foods,  playing football on the playground, running on the school road and so on. For you university life, the following are the advices for your university life. First of all, it is important for you to study hard and a good score is a key to get a good job after you graduate from school. What's more, try to join some associations, it is essential for you to communicate with other people which can make you more communicative. At last, don't play online computer games frequently, it is bad for your study.

  I wish you will have a good university life and I hope you can get a good score. If you have any trouble in school, you can call for me.

Best regards,
     Li Ming
