### 考点 1：介词(后面只加宾格)+关系代词(whom,which)

1. 先行词是人，介词后面用 whom(eg1)
2. 先行词是物，介词后面用 which(eg2)

```js
/*
eg1：The man to whom you speak is a teacher.
= The man whom you speak to is a teacher.

eg2：The city in which she lives is far away.
= The city which she lives in is far away.
*/
```

**介词的选取问题**

找固定搭配

1. 从句中谓语动词的搭配
2. 先行词的搭配

### 考点 2：关系副词 = 介词 + which

1. where = 介词(in/on/under 等) + which

```js
/*

eg：This is the colleage where we study together. 这是我们一起学习的大学
= This is the colleage in which we study together.
*/
```

2. when = 介词 + which

- year => in which
- day => on which
- 期间 => during which

3. why = for + which

### 考点 3：介词+关系代词的常见两种结构

1. the + 名称 + of which/whom(结构中名词和后面的关系代词为所属关系)

```js
/*
the cover of代指前面的book
eg：This is the book the cover of which is designed by Lucy.

例题：I bought a new bicycle, ___ was very high. 选A
A. the price of which B. which price C.price of which D. which the price
解析：A 带从属关系正确  B. which不行，应该使用whose，表示谁的 C. 缺少个the D. 格式错误
*/
```

2. 表示部分的词语 + of + which/whom
   some，most，either(两者中的一个)，neither(两者都不)，both(两者都), none(三种或三者以上都不),all(三者或三者以上都),every,each，数词，分数/百分比，最高级等。

```js
/*
eg: I have a lot of friends, most of whom are from GuangDong.
*/
```
