### 考点三：独立主格结构

独立主格结构：主语(名词/代词) + doing/done

```js
/*
君生我未生，我生君已老
When you were born, I was not born. 
When I was born, you were already old.
上面两个谓语中有连词when，如果要去掉连词则需要非谓语动词，下面是例子

You born, I was not born. (born是bear的过去式)
I born, you were already old.
*/
```

**独立主格结构的判断标准**

1. 前后主语不一致，只有一个谓语动词
2. 中间逗号隔开，且句子中没有连词

**考题形式 1**

1. 句子，主语+\_\_\_\_xxx
2. 主语 + \_\_\_\_xxx,句子

**解题要点 1**

判断选项与空前名词的主被动关系，如果选项动词先发生，选带 having 的

- 主动选：doing 或 having done
- 被动选： done 或 having been done

```js
/*
All flights ___ because of the snowstorm, we decided to take the train.
A. were canceled B.had been canceled C.having canceled D.having been canceled
all flights所有航班因为暴风雪被取消了，是被动取消，选done/having been done所以选D

*/
```

**考题形式 2.with 引导的独立主格结构**

公式： with/without + 独立主格结构(一般没有先后问题，也就是不带 having)
作用：表伴随

**考题形式 3**

特殊的 There/Such/One/It/主语 + being

```js
/*
It is a  holiday, many students went home.
上面有两个谓语且没有连词 这样是不复合语法的，必须换成非谓语动词结构being

It being a holiday, many students went home.
*/
```
