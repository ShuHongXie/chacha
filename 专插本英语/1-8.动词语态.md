### 考点 1：被动语态的结构

结构：be done(过去分词)

- 一般现在时: am/is/are + done
- 一般过去时：was/were + done
- 一般将来时：will be + done
- 现在进行时：am/is/are being + done
- 过去进行时：was/were being + done
- 现在完成时：have/has been + done
- 过去完成时：had been + done
- 将来完成时：will have been + done

```js
/*
He opened the door.(主动语态) 
转换被动语态为
The door was opened by him.(被动语态 )

*/
```
